## please introduce yourself and discuss your experience

I'm bulingfeng. I'm a Java develper with 8 years. I focus on backend development with using java language, building services with springboot and springcloud.

I have many experiences with SpringBoot and Spring Framework.

in the last company,I play a key role in developing and a learder for a team. My work contains two parties:

1. I will assign some tasks to the others.
2. I will write the core codes for the project.

and I can solve some complex issues, for example, a sql run very slowly, so I use the explain key word to analyse, then I add some index  to the colums and the sql run faster than before.Performance improved by 70%

## how did you optimize SQL queries

- avoiding select all columns
- add some indexes
- Using explain plan to analyze query performance and optimize it

## Why did you resign from last company?

because I think there is a big platform and more resource and chances in BeiJing, so I quit my job from Hangzhou.
