## what did you solve  the most difficult  things?

When I worked at Hailiang Education Company, One page show data slowly, that makes customer angry, so 

I anzyze the source code, find the key thing is the sql. That sql is a slow sql.

I use the explain key word to analze the sql,  the sql dosen't use indexes, so I add unique index on the order NO, and test it .

This sql just takes 1 second.
