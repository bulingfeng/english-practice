## 巴克利谈乔丹

伙计们好，巴克利曾经说乔丹其实一点也不帅，乔丹看起来帅，只不过是因为有几十亿美金，如果你有几十亿美金，那么你会变帅的。

对于这个观点我是非常同意的，因为曾经有调研研究说：同样一个人，分别让他开法拉利和本田雅阁，然后让女生们判断哪个人更帅，70% 的女生认为开法拉利的那个男生更帅。

> Hey guys, Barkley once said Jordan isn't actually handsome—he just looks handsome because he has billions of dollars. If you had billions of dollars, you'd look handsome too.

> I completely agree with this point of the view, because there was once a study that showed: the same person was asked to drive a Ferrari and then a Honda Accord, and women were asked to judge which man was more attractive. 70% of the women thought the man driving the Ferrari was more handsome.

> Do you want to be handsome? All you need is a few hundred million dollars.
