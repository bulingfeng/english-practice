很多人把自己没有天赋当做自己放弃做某件事第一借口，或许在某项技能上，人与人确实是有差异的，但是那又如何呢？按照他们的理论天赋真的是与生俱来的，不是后天努力得来的，那么你焦虑什么呢，反正你生下来就没有。对于你无论如何都不会改变的事情，请问你焦虑个毛线呢？

其实某个决策或者概念，首先要考虑它对自己的生活是否有指导性意义。而努力改进自己的技能，让自己慢慢的老练起来，这很明显就是对自己有指导意义的，既然是正向的指导意义，那么自己就努力去做喽，做的不好又如何呢？反正自己总是在慢慢变好的，不是吗？

从上面的分析来看，在我看来过度迷信天赋的人，其实他们更容易信命，在他们的世界中，他们更容易相信每个人生下来之后，他们的生命路径就已经固定了下来，从这个角度来看，信命的人虽然活着但是其实他们早已经死了。

古人常说：“台上一分钟，台下十年功夫”，说的多好啊。但是大多数人就是很奇怪，他们总是在无关紧要的领域追流行；但是他们又在自己需要创新的领域又极度保守，甚至不愿意接受哪怕一丁点新的思想。

话说回来在人类智慧方面，其实我们更应该接受古老的知识而不是流行的东西，因为越是古老的东西，越说明它们经受住了时间的检验，也就是说时间证明了这些知识的有效性，换句话说，在人类智慧方面，自己必须要重视一切的老生常谈。

现在很多人非常喜欢学一些流行但回头看毛线用没有的东西，甚至是一些畸形错误的东西。他们大概觉得新奇的东西就是好，他们认为老掉牙的东西谁不知道啊？！这样早成的结果就是，卖课的卖疯了，学习的韭菜学傻了！怪卖课的太黑心？！或许只是韭菜太傻逼！

Many people use their lack of talent as the first excuse to give up on doing something. Perhaps there are indeed differences between individuals in certain skills, but so what? If, according to their theory, talent is truly innate and not something that can be gained through effort, then why are you anxious about it? If you were born without it anyway, what’s there to worry about? For something you can’t change no matter what, why on earth are you stressing yourself out?

In fact, when it comes to a decision or concept, the first thing to consider is whether it has any guiding significance for your life. Working hard to improve your skills and gradually becoming more proficient is obviously meaningful and beneficial. Since it’s a positive guiding force, why not just go for it? So what if you don’t do it well? You’re still getting better bit by bit, aren’t you?

From the analysis above, it seems to me that people who overly fetishize talent are more likely to believe in fate. In their world, they’re more inclined to think that everyone’s life path is fixed from the moment they’re born. From this perspective, those who believe in fate may be alive, but in a way, they’re already dead.

The ancients often said, “One minute on stage, ten years of practice off stage.” How well put! Yet most people are so strange—they chase trends in areas that don’t matter, but in fields where they need to innovate, they’re extremely conservative, unwilling to accept even the tiniest bit of new thinking.

Speaking of human wisdom, we should actually embrace ancient knowledge rather than trendy stuff. The older something is, the more it proves it has withstood the test of time. In other words, time has validated the effectiveness of such knowledge. To put it another way, when it comes to human wisdom, we must value all the old, tried-and-true sayings.

Nowadays, many people love learning trendy things that, in hindsight, are utterly useless—or even distorted and wrong. They probably think novel stuff is inherently good and that outdated things are just common knowledge everyone already knows. The result? Course sellers make a fortune, while the gullible learners get duped! Blame the sellers for being too ruthless? Maybe the learners are just too naive!
