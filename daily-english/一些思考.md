现在总有些人抱怨自己的国家，他们对自己的国家充满了敌意，其实他们并不是从高纬度来观察这个国家，他们抱怨仅仅是因为自己过的不好。

而且还有一个问题，那就是，这个人其实从来没有想过，自己过的不好很可能并不是这个国家的问题，而仅仅是自己的问题，因为这个国家有大量人在幸福美满的生活着。

Nowadays, there are always some people who complain about their country and are filled with hostility toward it. But in fact, they're not looking at their country from a higher or broader perspective — their complaints often stem simply from the fact that their own lives aren't going well.

What's more, there's another issue: these people often never consider the possibility that their struggles might not be the fault of the country at all, but rather their own. After all, there are countless people in this same country who are living happy and fulfilling lives.
