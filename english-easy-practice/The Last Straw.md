## the Last Straw

there was a man named Tom, he worked at an office every day.

his boss gave him more and more work.

the only joy in Tom's work life was his sandwich.

every day he looked forward to lunchtime when he could finally relax and enjoy it.

one day Tom went to the break room but his sandwich was gone.

someone had taken it. that was the last straw for Tom.

he stormed into his boss's office and said "I quit", his boss was surprised" why are you quitting, Tom"

Tom replied" you gave me too much work and now someone stole my sandwich".

the boss looked embarrassed actually. Tom, I ate your sandwich but I'll make it up to you.

I'll double your salary and give you a full lunch every day.

Tom shook his head.

no I don't want that, I only have one condition. a high security fridge for my sandwiches.

the boss agreed and from then on everyone was happy.
