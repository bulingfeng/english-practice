## neck of the woods

 Hey Jake, I haven't seen you in ages. what's up?

hey Emma. yeah, it's been a while. how's everything in your neck of the woods?

pretty quiet as usual. how about you? still living by the park?

actually, I moved last month. I'm a bit closer to downtown now.

oh that's cool. do you like it there?

yeah, it's nice there's always something happening. but I miss the quiet of my old place.

I get that. sometimes  it's good to have peace.

true, maybe I'll visit your neck of the woods soon.
