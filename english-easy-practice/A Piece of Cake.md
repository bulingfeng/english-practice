## A Piece of Cake

Hi Tom! How's it going?

hey Amy! it's going well, just finished my **workout**. feeling a bit tired, but it's all good.

that's great! I've been thinking about joining the gym too. is it hard?

not at all. it's actually a piece of cake, you start with simple exercises and gradually increase intensity.

that sounds **doable**. I need to get more active. any tips for a beginner like me?

sure thing! take it slow, don't push too hard at first. consistency is key, and before you know it, it'll be a piece of cake for you too.

thanks Tom. I'll give it a try
